# FilePicker
A demo app for Xam.Plugin.FilePicker

In my effort to read and write to a file on a device, I found the Xam.Plugin.FilePicker which appeared to be quite promising. Picking a file to read works fine on Android and UWP. I am having the following issues:

1. On iOS, I'm having issues with profisioning profile. Anyone of youe can try it with your own profiles and let me know if it works.
2. On any device, when I do SaveFile(), I don't see the saved file anywhere. You can try after reading a file, change the file name and hit Save.
